## UI Development with Storybook

We use Storybook for UI development and documentation. All UI components must have corresponding stories.

### Guidelines

1. **Component Development**
   - Create component in appropriate directory
   - Add TypeScript types and documentation
   - Create story file in `src/stories`
   - Test all states and variations

2. **Story Requirements**
   - Document all props and variants
   - Include examples of different states
   - Test responsive behavior
   - Add to component categories

3. **Categories**
   - Pages (Botanica, Search, Plant Details, etc.)
   - Components (Navigation, Assistant, etc.)
   - Auth Components
   - Layout Components

4. **Testing**
   - Use Storybook Controls
   - Test responsive design
   - Verify interactions
   - Check accessibility

### Running Storybook

1. Start Storybook server:
   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```

2. Open browser at `http://localhost:6006`

3. Navigate components:
   - Use sidebar for navigation
   - Controls panel for props
   - Docs tab for documentation
   - Canvas for testing
